# Direct Preference Optimization for Neural Machine Translation with Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding
This repository contains the official implementation for the paper *Direct Preference Optimization for Neural Machine Translation with Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding*.

**Note**: This codebase is incomplete and is currently under active development and cleanup. We are working to improve the organization and readability of the codes. The scripts and DPO training codes (modified from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/eric-mitchell/direct-preference-optimization)) are provided for reference purposes.
